As a hip-hop artist, Xiuhtezcatl also often uses music to convey powerful environmental messages. He is also not afraid to confront the government head-on, as he was one of the 21 plaintiffs that sued the federal government for their lack of action on climate change.",
      "quote": "My father taught me to see the magic in everything. Growing up, magic was in the sunrise and the rainfall. In every expression of life, no matter how small. I think that that was one of the most valuable wisdom that shaped who I was as a young boy. It gave me the perspective to see what was behind the dysfunction of our society, of our broken world, our dying ecosystems and corrupt leaders.",

Both of Lopez's parents were Indigenous civil rights leaders in the 1970s, both taking part in the occupation of Alcatraz in 1969 and Wounded Knee in 1973, which called attention to dismal living conditions and civil rights abuses that Native Americans continued to endure. He himself has been an LGBTQ rights advocate. He identifies as Chicano, with roots in the Mexica people of Mexico, and Sicangu Lakota Oyate from South Dakota, though he grew up in Denver. He talked about the inclusive community he found at Standing Rock that compelled him to join the camp for three months instead of his initial one-day plan.",
